<p>Welcome to Sunway Tech Club’s HacktoberFest repo!</p>

<p>This is where you can find the profile of others, which had their pull requests approved in <a href="/profiles/">Profiles</a>.</p>

<p>Want your profile in here too? Come on over to <a href="#">our repo</a> and ask one of us on how to make your very first pull request if you don’t know how!</p>

<h2 id="getting-your-pull-request-pr-accepted">Getting your Pull Request (PR) accepted</h2>

<p>Other than the commands/buttons needed to get your PR sent to us, many repos out there in the wild will require you to follow certain guidelines to ensure a certain form of standard to their repo.</p>

<p>It is no different here, although our rules are certainly more relaxed than the others ;)</p>

<p>You need to make sure that your PR fulfils the following requirements when you are submitting your profile:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The name of your file must be in YYYY-M-D-title-name format, where you replace spaces with dashes. <em>Example: 2019-9-18-Making-Your-First-PR</em></li>
  <li>The top of your file’s content must have the following
    <blockquote>
      <hr />
      <p>layout: post
title: You’re up and running!
—</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>
